# Ruby: Acronym

Convert a long phrase to its acronym

Techies love their TLA (Three Letter Acronyms)!

Help generate some jargon by writing a program that converts a long name
like Portable Network Graphics to its acronym (PNG).


The tests use the Minitest testing framework. To install it run the command:

    gem install minitest

Run the tests with the `ruby` command:

    ruby acronym_test.rb

## Resources

If you have never used Minitest, check out [Intro to TDD][tdd] tutorial from Jumpstart Lab.
